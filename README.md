BriskIT is an iOS app that allows you to get IT help whenever and wherever your tech breaks down. Just send us a quick message of your issue, take a photo of the error message, and one of our distributed IT professionals will help resolve your issue. Currently, we're supporting IT help for Mac OS and Windows.
